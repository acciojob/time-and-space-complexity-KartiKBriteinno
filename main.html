    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that accomplishes its purpose with the least amount of time complexity,
        ensuring faster execution for larger inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. In algorithm analysis, we often use Big O notation (O(n)) to express space complexity. One example is when
        an algorithm's space usage grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical factor in designing algorithms for optimal performance.
